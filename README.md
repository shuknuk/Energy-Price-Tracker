# Energy Price Tracker

An application to visualize historical energy prices and calculate the optimal time to run appliances, with AI-powered analysis from Google's Gemini.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Price Chart**: View the last 7 days of hourly electricity prices in an intuitive and responsive chart.
- **Appliance Cost Calculator**: Input your appliance's power (in Watts) and runtime (in hours) to find the absolute cheapest and most expensive times to run it based on historical data.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Get a clear, actionable summary of energy price trends, peak/off-peak hours, and savings tips, generated by the Gemini API.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Sleek, dark-mode interface built with React and Tailwind CSS for a great user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charting**: Recharts
- **AI**: Google Gemini API via `@google/genai` SDK

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser. For local development, you would typically need a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment.

### 2. Set up your Gemini API Key

The AI analysis feature is powered by the Google Gemini API.

a. **Get an API Key**:
   - Visit **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)** to create and obtain your free API key.
   - Click on "Create API key" and copy the generated key.

b. **Make the Key Available**:
   - The application is designed to read the API key from an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
   - You must ensure that `API_KEY` is set in the execution environment where the application is hosted or run. For local development, this is often done by creating a `.env` file or by exporting the variable in your terminal before launching the development server.

   **Example (Terminal):**
   ```bash
   export API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   # Now run your development server
   ```

   > **Important**: Never commit your API key directly into your source code or share it publicly.

### 3. Running the Application

**Prerequisites**: Node.js
1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key.
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Data Source**: The application uses a mock service (`services/eiaService.ts`) to simulate fetching hourly energy price data. This mimics a real API from a provider like the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
- **Cost Calculation**: The `ApplianceCostCalculator.tsx` component uses a sliding window algorithm over the price data to find the optimal start time for an appliance based on its power consumption and run duration.
- **Gemini Integration**: The `GeminiAnalysis.tsx` component sends the simplified price data to the Gemini API. It uses a specific prompt to ask the model for an executive summary, cheapest/most expensive time windows, and an actionable tip. The response is then displayed in a dedicated card in the UI.
